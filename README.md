# Jonathans_Big_Cosmology_Automator

Welcome to the Big Cosmology Automator. This code is set up to do three components of a 3x2pt cosmological analysis that can be executed individually or consecutively:

1) The generation of a set of mock galaxy catalogues that simulate the observation of a next gen-like weak lensing survey
2) The measurement of the 3x2pt Power Spectra from the mock catalogues for a specified tomographic configuration - using the Pseudo-Cl estimator for the signal and analytic expressions for the noise Cls, which are then converted into bandpowers
3) The inference analysis to constrain the w0-wa Dark Energy Equation of State parameters from the measured 3x2pt data vector

[Code and documentation currently under construction!]
